# fillit

ABOUT

Project description: Arrange Tetriminos among themselves and determine the smallest square that can fit all of them.

HOW TO RUN TESTS
1. Open 'test.sh' and set the MYPATH equal to the path of the fillit you wish to test. Ex.

		MYPATH="/Users/molesen/Desktop/Hive/v_projects/fillit"

2. run the command

		./test.sh

3. it should then compile and run the tests. It will first show you the Error test, then valid tetri pieces and in the end do timed tests.


TESTFILES

I got inspiration from another gnl test from the student agadhgad. I'm not used to making testfiles with bash so I used agadhgad's structure and played around with the details to get a better understanding of how the script worked. I added my own details to the code in a way that made sense to me and changed all of the testfiles to my own.
